## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to create a website which shows understanding of third party apis in javascript. How to use and implement them, which can be seen more in the code. If this website works as the description above provides then I have met the criteria.
The understanding should display both knowledge and use of JQuery and Day.js

This is what it should resemble:

## Tests

If the website loads properly and contains a work day schedule properly displaying the correct date then it's a good start. From there you can test if the schedule saves plans or if it correctly shows what time it is and what time is in the past/future
